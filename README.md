# 99 Shades

- This is a Single-Page Application built in React as a personal project that extends the functionality of an ordinary
  color picker.

- There are about 2000 colors to iterate through / explore and up to 5 panes that make it possible to create a
  palette of your design.

- The colors can be edited in 5 different formats (RGB, CMYK ,HSL , HSV and Hex) and if you intend to use the values
  elsewhere, any one of them can be copied to your clipboard with a single click.

- There are several buttons for different kinds of functionality but all of them will display their functionality if
  hovered on for more than 2 seconds.

- The app is reasonably intuitive, easy to use and free.

- Currently [99shades](https://austingti.github.io/99shades/) is hosted on Github pages.

- All its code is also available for suggestions, improvements or even inspiration for your own similar projects.
